🫀 CardioNet – Intelligent System for Heart Disease Detection
CardioNet is a machine learning-based intelligent system developed to predict heart disease using real-world healthcare data. It demonstrates a complete ML pipeline—from data loading and preprocessing to training, evaluation, and optimization of various classification models.

📌 Objective
To build an end-to-end predictive system capable of identifying individuals at high risk of heart-related diseases using demographic and medical features. The system is trained on structured patient data and applies a range of classification algorithms for binary/multi-class outcomes.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used includes a wide variety of health metrics and patient attributes such as:

Age

Gender

Blood pressure

Cholesterol level

BMI

Smoking and alcohol history

Glucose levels

Heart rate and other diagnostic indicators

📍 The dataset is loaded directly from Google Drive in the notebook.

📈 Workflow Summary
Data Loading
Dataset is imported using pandas and structured into a DataFrame.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visual distribution of target classes

Correlation matrix heatmaps

Histograms for each feature

Data Cleaning

Missing values handled with SimpleImputer (median strategy)

Null values analysis

Outlier inspection

Feature Engineering

Polynomial features generation

Encoding categorical variables if needed

Feature scaling and transformation

Model Building
A diverse set of classification algorithms were tested:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Gradient Boosting
